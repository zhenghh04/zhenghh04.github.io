## About Me

### Education
- **Ph.D. in Physics**, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2016
- **M.Phil. in Physics**, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 2010
- **B.Sc. in Physics**, Tsinghua University, 2008

### Academic Biography

I am a Computer Scientist in the Data Science group at Argonne National Laboratory. My research interests include data management and parallel I/O, as well as large-scale distributed training. I apply high-performance computing and deep learning to various domain sciences, including physics, chemistry, and material sciences. I also co-lead the MLPerf Storage Benchmarking group, where I contribute to developing benchmark suites for evaluating the performance of storage systems for AI applications.

I received my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2016. My background is in condensed matter physics, with expertise in first-principle simulations using density functional theory and Quantum Monte Carlo. I joined ALCF as a Theta Early Science postdoc in 2016, working on developing and scaling density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. In 2018, I transitioned to the Data Science group, where I expanded my expertise in data science and machine learning.

My current projects include: (1) ExaIO/ExaHDF5 â€“ developing advanced features in the HDF5 library for efficient parallel I/O, such as caching and pre-staging on node-local storage and topology-aware collective I/O; (2) data management and I/O optimization for AI workloads; and (3) scalable image reconstruction algorithm development.

### Personal Biography
I was born in a small village in the south part of China. Both of my parents are farmers. But they wished all their children to study and not continue to be farmers. But thankfully, I myself also like study. I am always curious about the nature, and about the meaning of life. The former eventually led me to pursue a major in physics, all the way until PhD. The latter has been motivates me to search for the meaning and the purpose of my personal life and the whole universe, eventually led me to Christ. 

I became a Chrisitian at Hong Kong in 2010. I eventually know through Bible that Christ is the meaning of the my life and the purpose of the whole universe. God wants to dispense Himself in Christ through the Spirit into man, so that man will become His corporate expression in the universe. We were created to be vessels to contain God. And God desires Christ to be all and in all. I know that even my family life, work life, and personal life, are great means for me to know and experience and gain Christ. 

I got married with my wife in 2016, and moved to Glen Ellyn, IL right after our marriage. My wife is also a christian. We currently have two children. They are both enjoying the suburb life. They have many companions in the church life. 

I felt thankful that I can work at Argonne. I first worked as a postdoc at Argonne, focusing on developing some algorithms for calculationg electronic properties of interfacial systems and nano particles. In 2019, when machine learning and deep learning became popular, I joined the data science group as a computer scientist, working on scaling data science applications on ALCF supercomputers. Then in 2023, when LLM becomes very popular, I started working on training LLM models for scientific applications.  The things I am working on are very interested to me. On the other hand, the life at Argonne are stable enough so that I can continue to pursue my church life. I am able to participate normal church life in the church in Bolingbrook, and also serve in some capacity. At Argonne, we also have a Christian club. We have regular bible study each week. This has been a blessing to my life. 

### Personal Interests

In my free time, I like hiking, walking in various nature preserve. I also like to run Marathon. I have finished seven full Marathon. 

Besides talking to people about AI and LLM, I also like to talk to people about my faith, about bible. I regularly have appointments with people to read Bible and ministry materials together, and pray together. 

I told my wife that after I got retired, I would like to run a tea shop, and have people come to the tea shop to get to know them and also I can share my faith to them.
