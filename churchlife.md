## How I became a Christian
I first encountered the gospel during my university years when a fellow student asked, “Have you read the Bible?” My immediate response was, “Have you studied physics?” and I dismissed him. However, deep inside, I often pondered the meaning of life. Though physics fascinated me, it could not provide the answers I sought. I embraced values of perseverance and integrity, aiming to contribute to my country, but I always felt uncertain. Later, I explored Wang Yangming’s philosophy, believing that following one’s conscience was the ultimate truth. Yet, this too failed when tested in real life.

While I was studying in Hong Kong, my younger brother fell into severe depression, losing all hope. His world was engulfed in darkness, and no matter how hard I tried to help him with my philosophical beliefs, my efforts were no more than a fleeting matchstick, instantly swallowed by the vast darkness. I realized how powerless I truly was. My brother tried many ways to overcome his struggles, but nothing worked until he met some Christians and accepted the Lord. From that moment, his life was filled with hope and joy, and his inner world was completely transformed. Witnessing this, I became open to the Lord as well. Not long after, a senior from my research group invited me to a Christian gathering. What struck me most was the overflowing joy of the people there—whether professors or janitors, they all seemed full of life. They spoke of God as the eternal life who desires to enter humanity. Though I had never seen God, I tasted life through these believers, which led me to pray and receive the Lord.

Later, I studied the Gospel of John and read, “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.” I realized that the light my brother received was this very life, which had conquered his inner darkness. The Lord also said, “I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.” His words carried an undeniable authority, and I increasingly believed in God, recognizing that Jesus was indeed God. However, I struggled because if God was real, everything I had previously relied upon would have to be abandoned. I resisted this truth and tried to convince myself otherwise by researching Nobel Prize-winning physicists to see how many were atheists. Yet, despite my external resistance, my conscience was clear—Jesus is God. After months of struggle, I received an offer from UIUC, but instead of excitement, I was filled with fear and uncertainty about the future. I also became dissatisfied with my own personality. Seeking guidance, I returned to the senior who had first invited me to gatherings, and he shared Romans 6:4 with me: “We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.” At that moment, I longed for a new life, so I was baptized.

For the first three years after baptism, I did not experience much of the Lord. But in 2013, I attended a Christian training program, where I saw how real God was in the lives of other believers. They lived as if the Lord was truly with them every day. Desperate, I prayed, “Lord Jesus, if I do not experience You, then our relationship ends here—I will not attend another meeting.” I can testify that the Lord answered that prayer. Gradually, every verse in the Bible spoke directly to me. I had also surrendered my life to the Lord during that training, and I began to see His hand guiding me in my studies, work, and marriage. I learned to maintain an intimate fellowship with Him, involving Him in all aspects of my life, from research to personal interactions. The more I practiced this, the closer He became to me. One day, as I walked down the street, I spoke inwardly to the Lord and said, “Lord, I feel that having You is enough.”

Through studying the Bible and participating in training, I came to understand God’s eternal purpose. Gradually, I aligned my entire life with His will, living toward Him. I can testify that since believing in the Lord, I have lived with certainty and hope every day. As a hymn beautifully expresses, “This life’s journey seems so ordinary, yet it binds earth to heaven.” I hope that everyone read my story can also receive this precious Lord Jesus.
